/**
 * Utility class for Vaadin that allows to "link" the Vaadin {@link Upload upload} component to any other {@link AbstractComponent component}.
 * This is useful for custom styled components to provide a standard Vaadin upload functionality or 
 * when you want to trigger the upload functionality from other components based on a user event
 * (which is not possible via server-side calls since the browser blocks non-user originated events).

public class UploadLinker {
	
	/**
	 * Links any {@link AbstractComponent} to an {@link Upload} component. This means that upon a click on the linked component
	 * this click will be "forwarded" to the uploader and trigger its file selector window. Multiple uploaders can be successively
	 * linked to a single upload; multiple components can also be linked to a single uploader. Simply call {@link #link(AbstractComponent, Upload)}
	 * for each component/uploader combination.
	 * 
	 * Known limitations:<ul>
	 * <li> The linking is not permanent. If you reload a page you must reapply it.
	 * <li> Both the component and the uploader <em>must</em> be added towards the view where you want to use them. 
	 * <li> Both the component and the uploader <em>must</em> be visible (i.e., don't use {@link Component#setVisible(boolean)} with <b>false</b> as this removes the component from the DOM.
	 * <li> After the linking the upload component will be made invisible via CSS (style.display='none'). This may affect your layout! So best add the uploader at a convenient space - for instance at the bottom.
	 * <li> The component and the uploader <em>must</em> have their IDs set. See: {@link Upload#setId(String)}, {@link AbstractComponent#setId(String)}}
	 * <li> These IDs <em>must</em> be unique.
	 * <li> In case you build your UI lazily ensure that the components you want to link are present. This method waits an increasing amount of time (25ms, 50ms, 75ms, ...)
	 * for the components to be found and will time out after about 12s. (You can check successful/failed linkings via your browser's console.)
	 * <li> Other registered {@link ClickListener ClickListeners}  will still fire for the source component.
	 * </ul>
	 * @param component Component to receive click event and to forward from.
	 * @param upload Upload component to receive forwarded click event.
